This characteristic motivates me to constantly engage with new technologies, frameworks and systems.

I take a systematic approach, never lose my cool and keep an overview even in challenging situations. This characteristic is particularly helpful when debugging, dealing with legacy code or in interdisciplinary projects where coordination is required."

Whether designing a system architecture or communicating within a team - I always try to reduce things to the essentials without losing any depth. This ability not only supports technical implementation, but also promotes efficient collaboration."
